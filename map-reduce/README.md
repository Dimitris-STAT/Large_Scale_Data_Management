# Word Count with Hadoop MapReduce on Private Chivalry Text

This project demonstrates a word count example using Hadoop MapReduce with a text file (`private_chivarly.txt`) downloaded from Project Gutenberg. The process involves setting up a Hadoop environment within a Vagrant virtual machine, copying the text file to HDFS, and running a MapReduce job to perform word counting on the text.

Please refer to the map-reduce/docs/report.pdf for more details on the implementation.
